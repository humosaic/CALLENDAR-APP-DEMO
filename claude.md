## WORKFLOW (Claude Rules File with Starter Rules)
## These allow Claude code to follow the same reliable workflow for every request.

1.  Think through the problem.  Write a plan in task in tasks/todo.md
2.  The plan should be a checklist of todo items.
3.  Check in with me before starting work-I'll verify the plan
4.  Then, complete the todos one by one, marking them off as you go.
5.  At every step, explain what you have changed.
6.  Keep every change simple and minimal.
7.  At the end, add a review section in todo.md summarizing the changes.
